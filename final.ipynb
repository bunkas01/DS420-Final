    "## Predicting Final Round Team Compositions in Rainbow 6: Siege\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description of the dataset\n",
    "The data used is an official datadump from Ubisoft, the developers of the game. This data was released after the fifth competitive season of gameplay (In keeping with the games' story as a counter-terrorism first-person shooter, the seasons have operation names. This particular one was named \"Operation Velvet Shell\"). For the project, the full datadump, featuring a detailed round-by-round breakdown of matches, was used. Each round is detailed from the perspective of each involved player, and includes details on the operator used, the exact loadout of the operator in that round, general measures of the player's skill, and specific match performance statistics, such as the number of kills, and whether they were killed in the round.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a subset of approximately 200,000 entries from the data will be obtained. This subset will be sampled in such a way as to preserve round/match groupings, e.g. by date. Then, the data will be aggregated and reshaped in order to combine all per-player-per-round entries into a single entry per match, detailing the choices and statistics of all involved players, as well a relevant match data, e.g. map name and game mode. This aggregated form will be the final data used for training and predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description of the project\n",
    "Using the aggregated subset described above, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) will be trained to predict the team compositions of the Blue and Orange teams in the final round of a match. Since there are a large number of factors affecting a player's choice of operator in the game, such as personal preference, player skill with specific operators, the choices of other team members, and counterpicks to opponent's favourites, GANs are perfect for this role.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description of GANs\n",
    "TODO, also cite one of the neat articles on the subject to impress Dr. Miller more when the network inevitably fails to work properly."

    "#### Restructuring the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the limitations of the multi-level index in pandas, the optimal way to restructure the data into per-match rows is to construct a new dataframe. Additionally, as repeated queries are quite slow, an intermediate storage form of the data will be constructed, as a nested dictionary containing nested lists of the form: `{<matchid>: {<roundnumber>: [[row1], [row2], ...]}}` This intermediate representation will then be used to construct the new dataframe, as it will be both more computationally efficient and enable easier filtering of non-structurally compliant rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new structure requires that games have exactly six rounds played, as well as a full complement of five players, in order to standardise the length of input data to the GAN. Additionally, a number of details about individual player loadouts will be dropped, as the exact set of mods on each weapon is almost purely dictacted by the meta. Of more interest is the general weapon types selected by each op, even though this is still largely meta-dependent."
